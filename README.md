# SynthDiv
### *SynthDiv calculates the real zeros of an nth degree polynomial by synthetic division*
## **Usage**
- The program prompts the user for an integer that represents the degree of the polynomial
- It then asks for the coefficients separated by commas 
- Using that information, it automatically generates possible rational zeros and uses synthetic division to verify which zeros result in a zero remainder
## **Improvements to be made**
- There is zero error handling
- Duplicate zeros result frequently with higher factor values, causing duplicate results (performance impact negligible with lower values)
- No possibilities for
